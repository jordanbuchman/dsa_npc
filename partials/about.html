                Hi! I’m Jordan. I’m 17, and a high school student in Boulder, Colorado where the average house price is $1 million (although I live in one of the many surrounding commuter towns). The economic and racial inequalities I see on a daily basis, whether it’s hearing a student talk about their long weekend trip to Europe while some of my friends are on the free lunch program, or the fact that I have literally never seen one of my Hispanic peers (who make up 10% of the student population) in an advanced class, combined with the absolute failure of our local “progressive” politicians to meaningfully deal with these issues, made me realize at a young age that something is very, very wrong with our current system.

                I got involved in political organizing through the Bernie Sanders campaign, and redirected that energy towards the ColoradoCare (single payer healthcare) campaign after the primaries. After the election last year, which saw a spate of losses for progressive reforms at the state level, I formed an independent leftist organization at my school along with other now-DSA members. I joined DSA in early February of this year after being inspired by the work of chapters across the country, shortly before our chapter was accidentally dissolved. Alongside an amazing group of people, ranging from former NAM members to complete newcomers, we worked tirelessly to completely rebuild our chapter, its membership, and our relationships with other organizations. I’m incredibly proud to say that I’ve been serving as the chair of the Boulder chapter since June. When I’m not googling “how to use ActionNetwork” or responding to chapter emails, I try to find ways to use my technology skills to benefit our organizing work and our community as a whole.

                As the NPC job description says, “Being an NPC member, above all else, means contributing one of your most valuable commodities: time”. I constantly find myself trying to find things to work on for my local chapter, and I have a great deal of extra capacity that I want to dedicate to making DSA a better organization at both the national and local levels. Additionally, as a very young DSA, but not YDS, member, I want to make sure that other members in my position feel like the national organization sees them as an important part of its base, rather a group that’s solely the concern of YDS. And as someone who’s part of a small chapter from a region of the US that only has one other NPC candidate, I want our new NPC to show the geographic diversity that we’ve cultivated in the past year.

                Shortly before joining DSA, I and the student activism group that I lead organized a 300-person strong protest against Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of Colorado. This was completely new territory for me, and I learned valuable lessons about media, coalition building, and effective organizing.

                Once I joined DSA, I quickly put those lessons to use by organizing the first local May Day event in over a decade. It was a huge success, and the organizations we brought together ranged from the IWW to direct action anti-fracking groups to immigrant rights advocates.

                After learning that our chapter had been dissolved under the transition from a “Colorado DSA” to city-level chapters, we worked quickly to re-form: writing bylaws, organizing meetings, and dealing with a number of issues that were completely unexpected by a group of inexperienced socialists. At our local elections in June, I was elected as chair. My duties include running our social media accounts, managing our fundraising, coordinating meetings, and maintaining contacts with other organizations in the area and our comrades in DSA Denver and Colorado Springs.

    <h2>What's my vision for DSA?</h2>

            <p>
                I believe that DSA can become a force for the left in this country unlike anything we’ve seen for over 50 years, but we must understand why DSA appeals to so many and how we can continue to grow while keeping the almost 25,000 members that we already have. We’ve never been a centralist organization, and that’s why we’ve seen such massive growth recently. However, many of our newer chapters, mostly small, mostly inexperienced, and mostly far from the coasts, are constantly facing problems that they can’t deal with alone. I envision a DSA where the national organization provides things that many chapters aren’t able to do in-house, such as high-quality graphic design, experienced full-time organizers, legal advice, and a useful level of financial resources (preferably done through a dues splitting system not linked entirely to chapter size). I also want to see the other structures we have available, namely state and regional organizations, become commonplace across the country as a hedge against increased centralization and a way to help small chapters become even more effective than if they were just receiving support from national DSA. Solidarity comes in many forms, and in my experience even an informal relationship with the nearby Denver chapter has helped both of us immensely. I want every chapter to have that same opportunity.
